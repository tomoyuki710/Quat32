# Quat32
Compressing Quaternion to 32-bit in C# with Unity

Based on [muQuat32](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/MeshSync/blob/9d29838eb21249b3057613e0a0a23042a4bfd4ab/Plugin~/Src/MeshUtils/muQuat32.h) in [unity3d-jp/MeshSync](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/MeshSync), I attempted to write code using C#'s BitVector32 to compress Quaternion to 32 bits.
